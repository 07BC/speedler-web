_Last updated: 13 January 2026_

## TL;DR

- **Speedler does not track your location**
- **Your cycling data stays on your device**, or in **your own iCloud** if you enable it
- **No personal data is sold, shared, or used for advertising**
- **Anonymous metrics only** are collected to improve the app
- If you later choose to connect **Apple HealthKit**, that data stays under your control

---

## Overview

Speedler is a cycling app designed to help riders track, analyse, and reflect on their training and performance — without compromising privacy.

Speedler follows a **privacy-first approach**: collect as little as possible, store data locally, and give users full control.

---

## Information We Do Not Collect

Speedler **does not**:

- Track or store your real-world location
- Collect personal identifiers such as your name, email address, or phone number
- Track you across apps or websites
- Use advertising identifiers
- Sell or share personal data with third parties

---

## Cycling & Training Data

Any cycling or training data you create in Speedler (such as ride details, performance metrics, or notes):

- Is stored **locally on your device**
- Remains private and under your control

If **iCloud syncing** is enabled, this data may be stored in **your personal iCloud account** so it can sync across your Apple devices. This data:

- Is encrypted and managed by Apple
- Is not accessible to the Speedler developer
- Is never stored on Speedler-operated servers

---

## Location Data

Speedler does **not** collect, store, or transmit GPS or location data. The app does not rely on real-time location tracking.

---

## HealthKit (Planned Feature)

Speedler plans to support **Apple HealthKit** in the future.

If enabled by you:

- Health data will only be accessed with your **explicit permission**
- Speedler will read and/or write only the data types required for cycling and fitness features
- Health data will **not** be used for advertising or marketing
- Health data will **not** be shared with third parties

You can manage or revoke HealthKit permissions at any time via your device’s settings.

---

## Anonymous Usage Metrics

Speedler may collect **anonymous, aggregated usage metrics** to improve app stability, performance, and features. These metrics:

- Cannot identify you personally
- Do not include cycling content, health data, or personal information
- Are used only to understand general usage patterns (such as feature usage or crash diagnostics)

---

## Third-Party Services

Speedler may use Apple-provided services, including:

- iCloud for optional data syncing
- App Store analytics and crash reporting

These services are governed by Apple’s own privacy policies. Speedler does not include third-party advertising or tracking SDKs.

---

## Data Security

Speedler protects your data by:

- Keeping cycling and training data on-device or within Apple’s secure iCloud infrastructure
- Avoiding external servers for personal data storage
- Minimising data collection by design

---

## Your Control

You are always in control of your data. You can:

- Delete Speedler to remove all locally stored data
- Disable iCloud syncing at any time via device settings
- Control HealthKit access through iOS system permissions

---

## Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above.
